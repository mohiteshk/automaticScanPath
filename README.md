This is my internship project result. The goal was to create an alogrithm to plan an optimal path around a surface area. The traversal was to be done by a CMM(co-ordinate measuring machine). CMM had constraints of its own.

Watch VID-20180521-WA0004.mp4. We ran the software on the CMM and set it to scan the demo box. You can see it missing a few voxels but going back to get them later.
